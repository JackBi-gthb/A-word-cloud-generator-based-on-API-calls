# A-word-cloud-generator-based-on-API-calls
This project is a tool that scrapes a modern Chinese poet’s works, extracts high‑frequency imagery, and uses an API to assign emotion‑related colors before rendering a stylized, name‑shaped word cloud. It combines web scraping, text cleaning and segmentation, synonym merging, AI‑assisted color selection, and image generation into a simple pipeline.
